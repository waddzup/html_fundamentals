meta tag

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    ...
  </head>
</html>

The meta declaration belongs inside the <head> element, and should be specified within the first 1024 bytes of your page. So the earlier it is mentioned in your code, the better. 

W3C recommends placing it immediately after the opening <head> tag:

Can also use
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
but it is more complicated and not recommended

Character set is collection of characters, character <-> code point, code point <-> bytes

HTML Character References

Symbol					Entity 		Name	Entity Number	Usage
Less than '<'			&lt;				&#60;			Div tag: &lt;div>
Greater than '>'		&gt;				&#62;			Div tag: &lt;div&gt;
Ampersand '&'			&amp;				&#38;			Tom &amp; Jerry
Non breaking space ' ' 	&nbsp;				&#160;			If you add multiple spaces, the browser will remove all but one. So you have to use this entity to add multiple spaces in your HTML page.
Quotes "				&quot;				&#34;			Link to a another section on the same page using id of the element: &lt;a href=&quot;&num;timetable&quot;&gt;Displayed as: <a href="#timetable"> &quot; is generally encouraged for code. For an actual quotation, <q> or <blockquote> is preferred. 

If you are using a decimal number, use an ampersand symbol '&' , followed by the symbol '#', then a decimal number and a semi-colon. &#160;
If you are using a hexadecimal number, use an ampersand symbol '&' , followed by the symbols '#x', then a hexadecimal number and a semi-colon. &#x00A0
