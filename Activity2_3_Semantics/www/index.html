         - How are <header> and <h1> related?
           They are only related in that they help to structure an html page.
           <header> is a container for introductory content including:
           Authorship information, one or more <h1>..<h6> tags and a logo
           or icon. There can be more than one <header> on a page if 
           introductory information is required for multiple sections of the
           page.
           <h1>..<h6> identify headings in content. <h1> is the most
           important <h6> the least important. They can be used by
           screen readers announce the text and its level and to navigate the
           content.
           <header> cannot be used inside <footer> however, <h1>..<h6>
           can be used in both <header> and <footer>
         - Create a well structured html page using as many semantic
           elements as you can
         - Write a short html page using <div> and <span> tags

        <h3>The number of prime numbers is infinite</h3>
        <p>This is fact is also known as Euclid's Second Threorem. It was proved in 300 BC by
           the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid.</p>
        <p>To prove that there are an infinite number of primes Euclid showed for any
            prime p we can prove there is a bigger one. Consider the number formed by
        multiplying <em>all</em> the primes from 2 to a prime number p and then add one so:</p>
        <p class="equation">q = 2.3.5.7..p +1</p>
        <p>Stare at this for a while and you will notice that</p>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>q is bigger than the prime chosen, p</li>
            <li>q is not divisible by any of the prime numbers from 2 to p.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Consequently q is either prime or it is divisible by a prime beteween p and q.
        So however big the prime p we choose there is always a bigger one. So there are an
        infinite number of primes</p>
        <p>Try a few examples e.g. with p=11</p>
        <p class="equation">q=2.3.5.7.11+1</p>
        <p>Performing the arithmetic we get q = 2311 which is also a prime number. Note, the
        number q will not always be a prime number.</p>

            <p>Euclid wrote one of the most famous books in the world of mathematics called 
                <em>Elements</em>. This book sets out the foundations of geometry in a structured
                way using a series of Axioms and Theorems</p>

        <h3>Definition of even</h3>
        <p>An integer is said to be <span class="keyword">even</span> if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder.
            Integers that are not even are said to be <i>odd</i>. The numbers:</p>
        <p class="seq">2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12</p>
        <p>are all even. 0 is also even.</p>

        <h3>Powers of Two</h3>
        <p>The first few powers of two are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>0<sup>th</sup> power of two, written 2<sup>0</sup> = 1</li>
            <li>1<sup>st</sup> power of two, written 2<sup>1</sup> = 2</li>
            <li>2<sup>nd</sup> power of two, written 2<sup>2</sup> = 4</li>
            <li>3<sup>rd</sup> power of two, written 2<sup>3</sup> = 8</li>
            <li>4<sup>th</sup> power of two, written 2<sup>4</sup> = 16</li>
            <li>5<sup>th</sup> power of two, written 2<sup>5</sup> = 32</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may recognise some of these numbers. They often crop up as the sizes of usb memory
           sticks and mobile phone storage sizes.This is because alot of computing technology is 
           based on binary which is a numbering system based on the powers of two rather than the 
           decimal system which is based on the powers of 10.</p>

                <p>There is a story that a king was so pleased when shown the game of chess
                that he offered a reward to the inventor. The inventor thought for a while and then
                asked for a grain of rice to be placed on the first square, two grains of rice on 
                the second square, 4 grains on the 3 square and so on until the last square had 
                2<sup>63</sup> grains of rice. In total there would be 2<sup>64</sup>-1 grains of rice
                - a number 20 digits long!</p>
