Activity 1.5 Compare and contrast these two different HTML Style Guides:

jQuery - https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/html/
Google - https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html

Both were interesting especially the right and wrong examples. The bits the course has not covered so far were somewhat confusing (what is a TODO?). The jQuery guide was the more readable I found.

Google gave more detail e.g. always specify the protocal in src attributes (preferably https://), stuff about CSS, the use of hexadecimal, units....

Comments
Google mentions comments as optional. jQuery is quite specific in the layout - Capital first letter, must be a single space between comment token and first character of comment....

Agreeing points
Remove unnecessary whitespace
use utf-8 charset
use lowercase for names for elements and attributes
check the html syntax. Google suggest w3C validator, jQuery grunt htmllint
Always use alt attibute for images to help the visually impaired
Both recommend the separation of concerns - splitting html, css and JavaScript

Contradictory points:

Optional tags
Google suggest not to close optional closing tags (they say the rule is optional - tee hee) whereas jquery and this course say put them in. This includes not using <head> and <body> even closing</p>

Indentation
Google use 2 spaces never tabs
jQuery indent using tabs

w3schools has an html5 style guide and coding convention. It covers many of the points in the Google and jQuery with slight differences e.g. prefernce to make the html as simmilar to xhtml as possible. 

w3 Validator
I tried direct input for a simple web page I am working on  - I had missed an alt attribute for one of the images. I also tried my company website - there were some missing alt attributes on images and then some errors i did not understand e.g. Attribute ng-show not allowed on element a at this point. And the border attribute is obsolete.
