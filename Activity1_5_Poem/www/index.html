    <h2>Jabberwocky</h2>
      <!-- Is it ok to have single and double quotes in this poem?
          or should I be using character references -->
    <p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
       Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br>
       All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
       And the mome raths outgrabe.
    </p>
    <p>"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br>
       The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
       Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
       The frumious Bandersnatch!"
    </p>
    <p>He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br>
       Long time the manxome foe he sought--<br>
       So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br>
       And stood awhile in thought.
    </p>
    <p>And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br>
       The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br>
       Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>
       And burbled as it came!
    </p>
    <p>One two! One two! And through and through<br>
       The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br>
       He left it dead, and with its head<br>
       He went galumphing back.
    </p>
    <p>"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>
       Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>
       O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"<br>
       He chortled in his joy.
    </p>
    <p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
       Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br>
       All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
       And the mome raths outgrabe
    </p>
