    <p>This web page is a few thoughts about the use of images on the <a href="www.bbc.co.uk">BBC</a> website</p>

      <p>The BBC website has very different styles accross its' pages. The main news
         pages tend to use blocks for each news item or interest item. The block will
         contain a short piece of text, an image, and a category for the item. 
         The image may be a stock image e.g for an article on alcohol it may just show
         two glasses, for a football item it may be the actual footballer concerned or
         the shirt of the football club. In all cases the image can be considered
         <i>decorative</i> as the text describes the article and acts as a link.
		 <p>Parts of the BBC website have greater branding and a stronger visual style
		 such as the childrens education section Bitsize, the Horizon page and the Proms
		 pages. These use distinctive background images for headers, footers and section breaks.</p>
		 <p>The page <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/uk/sections/filming-techniques">Earth - filming techniques</a>
		 has a background image at the top of the page that is underwater video footage.
		 The main <a href"http://www.bbc.com/earth/uk">Earth</a> website has a moonlit beach background 
		 image that moves slightly as you move your mouse across the page</p>
		 <p>One section of the BBC that will always use informative imagery is the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/"> weather</a>
		 page which always has a UK map with symbols indicating the kind of weather to be expected. The weather map
         uses a background of the UK</p>
         <img src="http://static.bbci.co.uk/weather/0.5.4508/images/summary-map/infographmap.gif" 
		 alt="Outline map of the UK on which weather symbols are superimposed" title="UK map used on BBC weather page">
         <p>I haven't figured out how the weather symbols get superimposed. Hopefully by the end of the course I will.</p>
